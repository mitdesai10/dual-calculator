## ⚡ Key Formulas

### Blended Cost Rate
```
Blended Rate = Total Cost ÷ Total Hours
```

### Client Charge Rate
```
Charge Rate = Cost Rate ÷ (1 - Margin%)
```

**Example:**
- Cost: $100/hr
- Margin: 60%
- Charge: $100 ÷ (1 - 0.60) = $250/hr

### Profit
```
Profit = Revenue - Cost
       = (Charge Rate × Hours) - (Cost Rate × Hours)
```

### Margin Verification
```
Margin% = (Profit ÷ Revenue) × 100
```
