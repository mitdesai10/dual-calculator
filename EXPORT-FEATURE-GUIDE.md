## Tips

**Tip 1: File Naming**
Files are automatically named with the date:
- `quote_2024-11-25.xls`
- `quote_2024-11-25.csv`

Rename them for better organization:
- `acme-corp-proposal-2024-11-25.xls`
- `client-xyz-quote-nov-2024.csv`

**Tip 2: Excel vs CSV**
- Use **Excel** for client-facing documents (looks professional)
- Use **CSV** for importing into other systems (more compatible)

**Tip 3: Multiple Quotes**
Create several scenarios, export each one, compare side-by-side in Excel

**Tip 4: Archive Your Quotes**
Export and save all quotes for future reference:
- Create a folder: "Quotes 2024"
- Export each quote before sending
- Easy to reference later
