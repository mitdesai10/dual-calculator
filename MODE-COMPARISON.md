# 📊 Mode Comparison Guide

## When to Use Which Mode?

### 📊 Use Margin Mode When:

✅ **You have a fixed budget**
- Client gives you $X and you need to plan resources

✅ **You need to hit target margins**
- Your company requires 55-60% average margin

✅ **You're staffing a project**
- Need to determine how many people and at what rates

✅ **Budget is the constraint**
- "We have $3.4M, what can we staff?"

#### Example Scenarios for Margin Mode:
- Client RFP with fixed budget
- Internal project planning with budget approval
- Resource allocation for multiple positions
- Rate optimization to meet margin targets

---

### ⚖️ Use Blended Rate Mode When:

✅ **You need a single rate for proposals**
- Client wants one hourly rate for the whole team

✅ **You're analyzing rate structures**
- Comparing different team compositions

✅ **Creating pricing models**
- Building rate cards for different scenarios

✅ **Rate is the question**
- "What should we charge for this mixed team?"

#### Example Scenarios for Blended Rate Mode:
- T&M (Time & Materials) proposals
- Blended rate calculations for MSAs
- Comparing onshore vs. offshore team costs
- Creating standard rate cards
- Pricing analysis for different team mixes
