## How It Works

### The Formula

- Target Margin: 60%
- Client Charge Rate: $100 ÷ (1 - 0.60) = $250/hr

**Result:**
- You charge client: $250/hr
- Your cost: $100/hr
- Profit: $150/hr
- Margin: 60%

## Formula Reference

### Blended Cost Rate
```
Blended Rate = (Rate₁ × Hours₁ + Rate₂ × Hours₂ + ...) ÷ Total Hours
```

### Client Charge Rate
```
Charge Rate = Blended Cost Rate ÷ (1 - Margin%)
```

### Profit
```
Profit per Hour = Charge Rate - Cost Rate
Total Profit = Profit per Hour × Total Hours
```

### Margin Verification
```
Margin % = (Profit ÷ Revenue) × 100
         = ((Charge Rate - Cost Rate) ÷ Charge Rate) × 100
```
